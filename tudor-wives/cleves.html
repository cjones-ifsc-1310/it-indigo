      <h2>Anne of Cleves</h2>
     
      <p>Coming to England at the early age of 15, Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of Isabella of Spain and Ferdinand II of Aragon, was originally married to Henry's older brother and the original heir to the English throne, Aurthur Tudor. Unfortunately, that marriage lasted less than a year, when Aurthur was suddenly taken ill and then died of a cold.
        Swearing that the marriage was never consummated, Catherine and Henry were cleared by the Pope to marry, and they were wed in 1509. Despite the fact that Catherine was a popular, loyal, and pious queen, ruled by Henry's side for more than 20 years, and bore Henry six children, {only one, Mary, surviving infancy),
Henry grew increasingly frustrated with what he perceived as Catherine's inability to sire a male child and heir to the throne. Therefore, when his eye fell on the witty, pretty, young, Anne Boleyn, it was only a matter of time before the world was turned upside down.      </p>

      <h2>A Happy Ending</h2>
      <p>Only one child of Catherine of Aragon survived infancy out of the six children she bore Henry: Princess Mary. <p>Perhaps, had Henry not had a son born out of wedlock with another, he would not have been so convinced that the failure to produce a male heir had something to do with Catherine.</p>

          <p>One very well-known fact about Catherine of Aragon is that she was the most pious of all the Tudor Queens. She lived her life guided by the Catholic Church and was known for her devotion to her faith. A much lesser known fact is that after several of her miscarriages, Catherine took to wearing a hairshirt (a garment made of coarse animal hair, typically goat or camel, worn directly against the skin to cause constant irritation and discomfort) 24/7 as pennance for whatever sins she might have committed against her faith or God.  <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Catherine_of_Aragon/">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

          <ul> 
            <li>1525 - Anne Boleyn appears at court </li>
            <li>1526 - Henry's Great Matter is the talk of the court</li>
            <li>1527 - The Pope is contacted about the Great Matter and sends a legget to oversee an ecclesiastical court to settle the matter.</li>
        <li>1531 - Henry formally leaves Catherine</li>
<li>1533 - January - Henry marries Anne Boleyn</li>
<li>1533 - May - Marriage to Catherine is officially annulled</li>
<li>1533 - Mary stripped of her title of Princess and declared illegitimate</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Catherine continues to fight for her and Mary's rights and refuses to be addressed as anything other than Queen of England, until her death in 1936.</p>
