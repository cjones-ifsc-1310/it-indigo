      <h2>Jane Seymour</h2>
     
      <p>Coming to England at the early age of 15, Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of Isabella of Spain and Ferdinand II of Aragon, was originally married to Henry's older brother and the original heir to the English throne, Aurthur Tudor. Unfortunately, that marriage lasted less than a year, when Aurthur was suddenly taken ill and then died of a cold.
        Swearing that the marriage was never consummated, Catherine and Henry were cleared by the Pope to marry, and they were wed in 1509. Despite the fact that Catherine was a popular, loyal, and pious queen, ruled by Henry's side for more than 20 years, and bore Henry six children, {only one, Mary, surviving infancy),
Henry grew increasingly frustrated with what he perceived as Catherine's inability to sire a male child and heir to the throne. Therefore, when his eye fell on the witty, pretty, young, Anne Boleyn, it was only a matter of time before the world was turned upside down.      </p>

  <div class="text-col">
  <p>Only one child of Catherine of Aragon survived infancy out of the six children she bore Henry: Princess Mary. <p>Perhaps, had Henry not had a son born out of wedlock with another, he would not have been so convinced that the failure to produce a male heir had something to do with Catherine.</p> 
      <p>However, Henry, with the birth of his acknowledged illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy in 1519, was able to justify his belief that God was punishing him for marrying his brother's wife. His attempt to divorce Catherine became a worldwide scandal.
      It soon became widely known as the King's Great Matter across the nation and even across the world. </p>
      <p> The main reason for Catherine's refusal to have their marriage annulled was her fear of their daughter Mary being illegitimized and denied her rightful place in the succession. Despite her obstinance, the Princess Mary was temporarily removed from the succession and was to be called "The Lady Mary," instead.</p>
      <p>Despite this early drama, Mary was eventually restored to her rightful place in the succession and was recognized as a legitimate heir to the throne of England, taking her throne in 1553 as Mary I of England.</p>

          <p>One very well-known fact about Queen Jane is that she was the most demure of all the Tudor Queens. Her quiet and submissive demeanor, which stood in stark contrast to the outspoken Anne Boleyn, may have been the catalyst of Henry's attraction to her and what caused him to begin to seriously stray from Anne's side. <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/hampton-court-palace/history-and-stories/jane-seymour/">Read More &raquo;</a></p>

                    <p>After being married to Catherine for 24 years, and his ten-year affair and marriage to Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymore finally gave Henry the one thing he wanted more than anything else on earth: a son. Therefore, Queen Jane wins the ULTIMATE QUEEN CROWN AWARD for coming in clutch!</p>
