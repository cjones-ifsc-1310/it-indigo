      <h2>Catherine of Aragon</h2>
     
      <p>Coming to England at the early age of 15, Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of Isabella of Spain and Ferdinand II of Aragon, was originally married to Henry's older brother and the original heir to the English throne, Aurthur Tudor. Unfortunately, that marriage lasted less than a year, when Aurthur was suddenly taken ill and then died of a cold.
        Swearing that the marriage was never consummated, Catherine and Henry were cleared by the Pope to marry, and they were wed in 1509. Despite the fact that Catherine was a popular, loyal, and pious queen, ruled by Henry's side for more than 20 years, and bore Henry six children, {only one, Mary, surviving infancy),
Henry grew increasingly frustrated with what he perceived as Catherine's inability to sire a male child and heir to the throne. Therefore, when his eye fell on the witty, pretty, young, Anne Boleyn, it was only a matter of time before the world was turned upside down.      </p>

      <h3>Queenly Stats:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Born:</strong> 16 December 1485</li>
                <li><strong>Married:</strong> 11 June 1509</li>
                <li><strong>Reigned:</strong> 1509-1533</li>
        <li><strong>Divorced:</strong> 23 May 1533</li>
        <li><strong>Children:</strong> Mary I of England (1516-1558)</li>
        <li><strong>Died:</strong> 7 January 1536</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Progeny</h2>
      <p>Only one child of Catherine of Aragon survived infancy out of the six children she bore Henry: Princess Mary. Perhaps, had Henry not had a son born out of wedlock with another, he would not have been so convinced that the failure to produce a male heir had something to do with Catherine. However, Henry, with the birth of his acknowledged illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy in 1519, was able to justify his belief that God was punishing him for marrying his brother's wife. His attempt to divorce Catherine became a worldwide scandal, as back then, men did not divorce good and proper wives without serious justification.</p>
      <p>It became known as the King's Great Matter across the nation and a defining moment in English history. However, Catherine, knowing she was born of Kings and Queens and that she was born to live and die as Henry's Queen, was obsitnate in her refusal to divorce Henry, and even upon Henry's dubious divorce being approved, refused to answer to any title besides that of Queen until the day she died.</p>
      <p> The main reason for her refusal was her fear of Henry deposing their daughter Mary from the line of succession. Despite her refusal to divorce Henry, Mary was temporarily removed from the succession and to be called "The Lady Mary," instead of "Princess" due to her refusal (as a staunch Catholic) to acknowledge Henry's ultimate rule over the church of England.</p>
      <p>Despite this early drama, Mary was eventually restored to her rightful place in the succession and was recognized as a legitimate heir to the throne of England, taking her throne in 1553 as Mary I of England.</p>
